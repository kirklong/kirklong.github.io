								<!-- Items contained in <b> tags are bolded! -->
								<b>Education:</b> I will graduate in May 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in 
								Physics (Astrophysics emphasis) with minors in Music and Applied Mathematics!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								I'm broadly fascinated by computational astrophysics, both in the modelling of 
								complex systems and the analysis of vast amounts of data. I'm particularly interested 
								in high energy astrophysics and the time evolution of universal systems, and my current
								research project combines all of these passions as we search for accreting x-ray binaries.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What I do for fun:</b> 
								I enjoy being outdoors, playing complicated board games, drinking wine, trying and learning new things, 
								playing the piano, and - most importantly - spending time with the people I love. I like to tinker with sciencey things, and over the years I've built homemade
								fireworks and rockets, made rudimentary metal sculptures in a homemade kiln, and created a fun Twitter bot!

								<b>Identifying accreting x-ray binaries</b><br>Searched for new x-ray pulsars by cross-referencing archival XMM-Newton and CHANDRA data and looked for 
								changes in period that could be caused by accretion. More info and code samples available on my <a href="https://github.com/kirklong/research">github</a>.

							<p>
								<b>Teaching:</b> I've taught various university physics labs, hosted our department's drop-in tutoring center for the last two years, 
								inspired future scientists over summers and breaks in designing and teaching STEM curricula at our local YMCAs, 
								and I've even volunteer taught a programming course for the past year in a prison!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b> I have the coolest spring - fall job working weekend nights running the largest telescope in the state of
								Idaho at the Bruneau Sand Dunes State Park observatory, where I also get to share my love for astronomy through 45 minute public talks I create.
								I also take physics/science demos to two of our local prisons once a week and occasionally guest teach physics lessons in their GED programs.
								Over my winter 2019 break I got bored and created my first <a href="https://twitter.com/ThreeBodyBot"> Twitter bot </a>, which creates and posts 
								random gravitational three body simulations. In my first two years of university I was privileged to have a science communication internship for 
								<i>StarTalk</i>, where my largest responsibility was writing science/astronomy <a href="https://www.startalkradio.net/?s=kirk+long"> blog posts </a> 
								which were shared out to an audience of ~500,000 with other outlets occasionally sharing them as well.
