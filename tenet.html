          <p> <i>Image credit: Warner Brothers</i> </p>
					<p> <b><em>Warning: mild spoilers, gratuitous profanity ahead...</em></b> </p>
          <p> Like most sane people, I thought it was a little absurd that Christopher Nolan
            was so insistent on the "theater experience" that he proceeded with a "full" theatrical
            release...in a pandemic. Box office numbers show that most people thought similarly, but
            with the film finally available to rent/buy I was excited to have some new quarantine
            entertainment...it did not live up to the hype. I watched the film twice &mdash; I liked it even
            less the second time, but I wanted so desparately to love it! Nolan's films are some of my favorites
            (<i>Inception</i> <em>is</em> my favorite) but unfortunately <i>Tenet</i> dissapoints, and I find
            myself wishing I could walk through a turnstile to stop myself from wasting the five hours and $6 I
            spent on both viewings.</p>

          <p> As an unnamed (and of the few female characters) scientist explains to "the protagonist" (seriously,
            the main character [Washington] is nameless and refers to himself only as "the protagonist") early in the movie,
            "don't try to understand it, just feel it" &mdash; she's talking about "inversion", a super cool
            entropy-reversing technology that allows objects and people to reverse their temporal direction, which
            is elaborated on later with some remarkably stupid technobabble bullshit by a character who
            ostensibly holds a masters degree in physics. This explanation feels a bit meta, as it's clear Nolan wants us
            in the audience to do the same thing given that the entire fucking film is a wash of absurd contradiction
            that falls apart at the slighest glance off from the picture he's trying to paint. The movie might still have
            been fun (even worthwhile!) if it didn't take itself so seriously, or if (god-forbid) it told a story worth feeling
            anything over. unfortunately, aside from Neil (Pattinson) every character is remarkably one-dimensional and wholly
            unremarkable. The villain is particularly bad ("if I can't have her, no one can" where her is both the girl and the Earth
            &mdash; eyeroll), and the fact that our protagonist was willing to kill himself to protect his CIA compatriots yet feels
            the need to jeopardize the entire world several times over to save a random woman he has no chemistry with is eyeroll level absurd.
            (<em>Aside:</em> why not just save the world first, then go back and save the girl? Because that's too easy...)
            While perhaps unsurprising, it's still dissappointing to see Nolan's incredibly male-centric worldview
            laid bare in the film &mdash; but it is nice to see some male diversity, I guess? Debicki shines as Kat when given the chance,
            but save for a satisfying final scene she's underused and oversaved. </p>

          <p> Nobody has any motive for anything, nobody (audience and Nolan included) understands what the fuck is going on,
            and everybody knows the whole thing is paradoxically stupid, even breaking the fourth wall several times to shrug off
            some of the more obvious plot holes with the wonderful adage, "whatever happened, happened" (a saying that only applies
            to the plot points Nolan wants you to think about). A second watch makes the plot more coherent and exposes several
            Easter eggs from the beginning of the film, but it also exposes more deeply the many, many problems with the characters
            and the plot as you're no longer as distracted by trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. It's confusing for the sake
            of being confusing, and unlike Nolan's other films there's no payoff for "figuring it out" &mdash; it's arguably worse once you
            have an inkling of what's going on. Another recurring theme is that "ignorance is our weapon", which is something the film
            clearly hopes the audience takes to heart. </p>

          <p> Nolan is still groundbreakingly brilliant as ever with the camera, and the visual style is both very well done and
            entirely unprecedented, so it has that going for it, I guess. It's a shame that this shine is just a veneer, because
            there is real potential in parts of the premise. Time travel undoes everyone, I guess, Christopher Nolan especially.
            Fortunately for him 2020 is a year we'd all rather forget &mdash; hopefully <i>Tenet</i> will fade from our collective
            memory sooner rather than later and Nolan will get back to winning ways, preferably with a film that manages to pass
            the Bechdel test.</p>

          <p> 6/10 (mostly for VFX porn)</p>
