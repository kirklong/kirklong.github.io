# kirklong.github.io

The template used to make this site is available [here](https://themeforest.net/item/cards-personal-vcard-resumecv-portfolio/13066785) -- please do not just copy it from this repo! It's important to support creators, and it only costs $17 :)

That being said, after purchasing it if you are interested in some tweaks I made feel free to gander at the code here. To get the custom domain (kirklong.space) I used Google domains, paying them $20/yr for the privilege of a more personalized site name, but it just forwards to the original github.io site, so all the hosting is still done for free with Github pages.
