				<div class="blog-single-content">
          <p>If you have an astute memory, you may recall that one of my new year's resolutions in 2024 was to "quit" social media &mdash; while I didn't formally delete my accounts, I have successfully avoided using Instagram/Twitter/Facebook for more than a year now and it has been great!
            While I have succeeded in this aspect of my resolution, you may also recall that I said I would write a blog post every few months to keep in touch with friends and family...and in that regard I have failed pretty badly. 
            Originally this idea was motivated by all the cute New Years letters I love receiving from friends and family every year with their "year in review", and I thought I would do something like that but 
            on faster timescales than a year! Well it's now July 2025 and the last one was February 2024, so I'm in fact doing worse than the yearly letter format...oh well, sorry for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary reason for my absence is that I'm lazy, but in addition my life has been pretty crazy in the last year &mdash; so there will be lots of good updates for you in this letter!
            There have been lots of ups and downs, of which here is a quick summary:
            <p>First, the downs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you haven't heard already, Hannah and I broke up last summer, so those were a rough couple of months for me.
                    While it was a really hard time it was definitely what was best for both of us, and thanks to
                    my friends, family, and lovely therapist I have come out the other side with a lot of clarity and peace. I'll
                    always be grateful to Hannah for the adventures we had together and wish her and little Spud all the best!
                </li>
                <li>
                    I struggled for a bit last year finding purpose in my work and was feeling pretty burnt out. This is common 
                    in academia and for later PhD students but it was still tough. Thanks again to my awesome therapist for 
                    helping me through this and I'm happy to report that I am feeling much better about everything now and am 
                    really excited about my current work in a way I've never been before!
                <li>
                    American science is being dismantled by the current administration...so it's a tough time to be almost done with your PhD.
                    My department chair joked the other day that my cohort has gotten pretty bad bookends to the PhD experience as we started in 
                    COVID and are ending with this...and to make it worse the tech job market (where I would probably go if I don't get a postdoc) is not doing much better.
                    So I've got some looming anxiety surrounding graduating in the near future...but it will all work out one way or another!
                </li>
            <p>Now that the bad news is out of the way, the ups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have gone to Italy three times in the past year! Twice for work, all for fun... Highlights include mountaineering 
                    in the Dolomites on the via ferratas, skiing in the Dolomites with a lovely group of old friends, late nights on the 
                    Adriatic coast with new friends, paragliding during a conference lunch hour, presenting my work in a Baroque era palace, and of course all the stereotypical 
                    sightseeing and food. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have had lots of time to see family and friends this year &mdash; my brother Brandon got married, we've had 
                    two family "reunions" at Bear Lake (where I'm writing this letter now), I got to visit Nika in sparkly Seattle summer (and am going back soon!), and I've visited California twice to see 
                    the beach and grandmas in CA, in addition to all the Boulder shenanigans with my friends here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My second paper has been officially published! It's a result I'm really proud of &mdash; basically we found that 
                    the current models of a region surrounding supermassive black holes that I study don't work, and we posit a few ideas 
                    to solve this problem. This means that a specific textbook diagram of the geometry of active galactic nuclei needs an 
                    update &mdash; you  can read the paper in its entirety <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adda38">here</a> and a plain-language summary of it <a href="RMProblem.html">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My house is sicker than ever. Come and stay if you want! I've got a foosball table, a beautiful yellow couch, a thriving fish tank, 
                    and I recently acquired a very sketchy but extremely fun trampoline for the backyard...I also got this cool job in the grad housing where I don't have to pay rent 
                    anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm *almost* (knocks on wood) done with my PhD! I am working on two more final projects right now and will probably graduate next spring/summer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have a new girlfriend! Her name is Ayla and she is also a PhD student in my department (although she studies the Sun, so pretty far from black holes). We started dating in December.She is very smart and sweet and funny and I like her a lot &mdash; it's going really well so far!
                    We love to play soccer together, cook hippy veggie food for each other, and go on lots of adventures near and far!
                </li>
                <li>
                    I continue to enjoy all of my usual hobbies (soccer, skiing, hiking, music, etc.) and have recently added a new one: stained glass! 
                    Ayla found a bunch of free glass on Craigslist so we said YOLO and got the rest of the supplies and have been making some fun stuff.
                    If you want to try it out let me know and I'll teach you!
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            What's next?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I'm going to visit Benoit and Bruno in Montreal for a weekend in August! Excited to see Benoit's sick new loft and to see Bruno for the first time since I visited him in Brazil in 2019.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am going back to Europe in September for a conference at Cambridge + talks in Scotland and Germany! Will also of course throw in a big hiking adventure with Dakota where we will walk from Mt Blanc to the Matterhorn. Let me know if you want to join! :) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am going to be really stressed as I start applying for jobs lol. I am working a lot these days to try to crank out another paper or two before I graduate and I am excited about some new collaborations I have!
                </li>
                <li>
                    My mom had such a good time skiing last year that this Christmas the whole family is going to come out and visit me in Colorado to ski! I'm really excited to show them around and hopefully will be less stressed by then. :) 
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Finally, it's time for a photo dump! Instead of uploading individual photos I've put together three photo montages for my adventures in Italy, fun times with family, and some favorite memories with friends + miscellaneous adventures. Click the links to watch them on YouTube in fullscreen with musical pairings lol. Enjoy!</h3>

            That's all for now...hope you enjoyed this "update" and I will try to be better about writing these in the future. And if you're so inclined send me 
            some photos of whatever you have been up to, especially if we haven't chatted in a bit as I would love to catch up and 
            hear from you!
